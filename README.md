# gender-prediction-using-ML
This project implements an age and gender classification model using TensorFlow and the pre-trained VGG16 network. It uses a custom data generator to handle image preprocessing directly from pixel strings in a CSV file. The model is trained to predict gender using transfer learning techniques.
